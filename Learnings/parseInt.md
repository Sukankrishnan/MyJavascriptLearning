parseInt is used to parse a string element and returns as an integer.

Let us see the examples:

I initialize two variables as String.

        var number1="10";
        
        var number2="20";
        
        console.log("Type of number1 is "+typeof(number1));
        
        console.log("Type of number2 is "+typeof(number2));


The result of the above code is 

        Type of number1 is string
        
        Type of number2 is string
        

When I try to add, it concatenates the values

        //add two strings - concatenation
        
        var total1=number1+number2;

console.log(`Total of two numbers is ${total1}`);


Result
    Total of two numbers is 1020
  Total of two numbers is 1020
